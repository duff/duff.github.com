title: Think We're Free?

"This article":http://www.wnd.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=59566 makes me wonder.  It's another case of government "officials" overriding the wishes of parents.

Should I be surprised?  We have compulsory education laws saying that our children must be in school for X number of days.  Where did government get the right to tell us what our children ought to be doing?
