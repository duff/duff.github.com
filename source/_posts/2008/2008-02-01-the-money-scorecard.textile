For the final 3 months of 2007, the Republican candidates raised the following:

* Ron Paul: $19.95 million
* McCain: $9.9 million
* Romney : $9.2 million
* Huckabee: $6.7 million

So Ron Paul more than doubled the other candidates.

Cash on hand at then end of the quarter:

* Ron Paul: $7.8 million
* McCain: $2.9 million
* Romney : $2.4 million
* Huckabee: $651 thousand

Romney did chip in an extra $18 million of his own dough during the quarter.

Ron Paul is crushing the competition in terms of raising money.  So far, that hasn't translated into crushing the competition at the voting booth.  Will it ever?
