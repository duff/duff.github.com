title: What's $1.5 Billion When You Can Just Print It?
---
Let's just think things through for a second.  The federal government takes money from some "to buy analog tv converter boxes for others":http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20080215/ap_on_hi_te/digital_tv_coupons.  It'll only cost $1.5 billion.  Coupons will be sent soon.  

Perhaps this program will help to distract the populace from all of the other unconstitutional activities the federal government is involved in.
