I'm seeking some investment capital for a new project.  I'd like to make a man-made island in the center of an ocean somewhere.  I'm thinking it could start out maybe the size of Rhode Island.  Maybe smaller.  It will of course grow over time.  It will be a sovereign nation tentatively named Libertonya.  The citizens of Libertonya will be truly free.  It will be a self sufficient nation.

For you investor types reading this blog, I'm looking for about $25 billion to start out.
