title: "Customer Service Delight"
---

In [writing about customer service](http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2009/07/welcome-to-island-marketing.html), Seth Godin has said that 

> every interaction matters and every customer is precious... Every interaction is both precious and an opportunity to delight.

I think this is extremely wise advice and it's incredibly difficult to implement.  It takes time, effort, patience, and perseverance.  It takes love.
It takes actually caring about the person on the other end of the support request.

For the last few days, I've been on point for [Spreedly](http://spreedly.com) support while [Nathaniel's](http://blog.talbott.ws/) been on vacation.
The experience has given me an entirely new appreciation for how challenging the task is, and how adept Nathaniel is at it.  

The question that comes to mind is, if the business you're creating has a product or service that's *remarkably good* and you knock customer service
out of the park by attempting to delight people, how could it not succeed?
