I wanted to mention that I recently took part in the Q&A session that "Seth Godin":http://www.squidoo.com/seth offered to people buying 11 copies of his book.  I won't go into any details, but suffice it to say that it was incredible.  He is a marketing super genius and he had a huge impact on the entrepreneurs on the phone call.  I greatly enjoyed it.

I'll also say that there are gonna be lots of changes at Soapbox over the next few weeks.  He had ideas that I don't think I ever would have thought of.  And even if I had thought of them, I don't think I would have had the guts to proceed with them because they're so different than what I was thinking.  I'm really excited about the feedback he provided.
