title: New Soapbox Enhancements
layout: post

I've made some improvements to "Soapbox":http://soapboxit.com based on additional user feedback.

* I improved the invitation email to make it less likely to be ignored.
* The site now explains how to connect as a friend to an existing Soapbox user.  Previously the user was led toward entering a user's email address.  Now they're made aware of this other option.

I also added some Google Ad Sense advertisements and I hooked into the Amazon Associates program.  So now the site has the _chance_ to start paying for itself.
