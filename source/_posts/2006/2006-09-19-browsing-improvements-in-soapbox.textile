title: Browsing improvements in Soapbox
layout: post

A number of the pages in "Soapbox":http://soapboxit.com contain a list of reviews.  Until now, these lists contained each review in its entirety.  This was clearly sub-optimal, especially as more and more detailed reviews have been written.  I released an update to address this issue which allows users to see many more reviews at a time while lowering the amount of scrolling they need to do.  I think it's a significant improvement and it will facilitate some other enhancements that are on the way.

You can get a feel for some of the changes by looking "here":http://soapboxit.com/browse.
