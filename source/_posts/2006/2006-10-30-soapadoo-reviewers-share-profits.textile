title: Soapadoo Reviewers Share Profits

I recently decided that the profit that the "Soapadoo website":http://soapadoo.com generates should be shared with reviewers.  50-50.

The reviews on Soapadoo are assets. They were created by reviewers who were willing to take the time and energy necessary to create worthwhile reviews others can benefit from.

The Soapadoo website generates revenue primarily through relevant advertising. This money is now shared with reviewers. It would be foolish for Soapadoo to keep all of the profit when the reviewers are doing so much of the work. The reviews on Soapadoo provide value to the people reading the site. The reviewers are now compensated for providing this value.  If you're a blogger, this is another reason to "re-publish the reviews from your blog":http://soapadoo.com/info/for_bloggers onto Soapadoo.

If you'd like more information about the program, you can "read more about it here":http://soapadoo.com/info/financial_benefits.
