I spent some time over the last few weeks gradually upgrading this site to use the latest [Octopress](http://octopress.org).  I'm amazed how much
[Brandon's](http://brandonmathis.com) framework has improved over the years.  I was still using the version he created about 8 hours after he started
working on it at the first [LessConf](http://lessconf.lesseverything.com).  Thinking about it makes me wonder how many great things have been created in the
lobbies of hotels at geeky conferences.

The upgrade also gave me a good chance to move it from Slicehost to [Github pages](http://pages.github.com).  Another slice goneski!
