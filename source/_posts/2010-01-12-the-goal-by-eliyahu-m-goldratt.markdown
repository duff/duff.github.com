Wow.  [What a book](http://www.amazon.com/Goal-Process-Ongoing-Improvement/dp/0884271781/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1263309279&sr=8-1).  Who would have thought that a book about how to convert a factory from a money loser to a profitable enterprise could be so
entertaining and engaging?  Who would have thought that you could teach business principles using a novel?  It's really a brilliant book.

I can't stop thinking about how to apply the principles to [Spreedly](http://spreedly.com) and [No Kahuna](http://nokahuna.com).  

This book makes me want to someday own a factory and make "real" stuff.  I wonder if there's a business owner out there who can actually put this
book down.
