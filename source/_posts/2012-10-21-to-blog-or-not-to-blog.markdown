Marco Arment's blog post about [lasting value](http://www.marco.org/2012/05/03/lasting-value) caused me to re-assess what on earth I'm doing with this site and whether I ought to even have it.  I
can certainly understand the perspective of [shutting down a site](http://weblog.jamisbuck.org/2011/9/1/shutting-down) if it's something you're no longer passionate about.

For me, I've never been extremely passionate about blogging; but it is nice to at least have a place to occasionally express a thought that gets captured and remembered.  Looking back on the posts
over the last few years, I've noticed that some of them are pretty pathetic.  Others are outdated.  Others express a viewpoint I don't really agree with anyore since my opinions have since
changed.  But it's ok.  It's not a reason to eliminate the site.  And it's also ok to have a blog and not update it very frequently.

I'm starting to think that it's similar to looking back at old code you've written.  More often than not, if the code is more than a year or two old, it probably looks pretty weak now.  This is because
you've improved as a coder and the way you're doing things now is so much better.  But you keep coding.

So I'm keeping the blog around with no pressure to regularly add posts.  I know there will be posts that potentially reveal a lack of intelligence on my part.  But that's ok too.

Perhaps a blog post can simply be a thought or idea that doesn't fit in an App.net post or a tweet.  Perhaps it's just a glimpse into where I'm at right now.
