I met a dad in the pediatric intensive care unit whose child had been in the neonatal area of the hospital for 3 months.  I asked him how things went with work and how he and his wife were able to spend so much time at the hospital.  He replied that he's a business owner and that his work wasn't too affected by the long hospital stay.

Creating assets that provide value to people is important.  Producing more than we consume is important.  Figuring out how to live in a way such that your income is not solely based on the time you spend working is important.
