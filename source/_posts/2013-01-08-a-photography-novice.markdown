It's been a few short days since the [photography experiment](/blog/2013/01/02/a-study-of-photography/) began.  I'm a complete novice, which is probably one of the reasons I'm finding it so enjoyable.  I've learned that having [a decent camera](http://www.dpreview.com/previews/panasonic-lumix-dmc-lx7/4) allows you to take [photographs](http://500px.com/duff) that just aren't possible with an iPhone, even if you don't know what you're doing yet.

I've been learning about RAW versus JPG.  I've been learning to delete most of the pictures I take because if I don't, I'll be buying more hard drives.  I've been learning about how to really use manual mode on the camera.

I've been learning about how great [Aperture](http://www.apple.com/aperture/what-is.html) is at improving photos, especially if you didn't get the exposure just right.  I finally learned about white balance and how it was the cause of so many of my photos having an odd yellow tinge.

I marvel at the folks who learned about photography before it was a digital endeavor.
