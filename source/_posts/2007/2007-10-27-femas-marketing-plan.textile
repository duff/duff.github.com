So let's get this straight.  There's an agency of the federal government that "got caught staging a phony press conference":http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/21490838/ by having employees pretend to be reporters asking questions.  What on earth is going on?

I would love to know whose idea this was.

What are the consequences when a publicly traded company deceives the public?  The market typically pummels them.  What happens when a federal government agency does the same?  I suspect they'll get even more funding to clean up their act.
