title: Republicans and Democrats - Perfect Together
---
For many decades now, Republicans and Democrats keep taking turns being in power.  Each group works to make the federal government stronger in different ways.  But the goal of both is the same - grow the federal government and make it stronger.  They both hurt the cause of liberty and they both disregard their oath to uphold the Constitution.  As each term ends, the government is an even stronger, more coercive monopoly than when they started.

Republicans and Democrats help each other.  Each thinks it's ok for the government to dictate how we live our lives and how we spend our money.
