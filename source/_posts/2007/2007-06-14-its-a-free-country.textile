When I was younger, it seemed like that was a commonly used statement.  I don't seem to hear it much anymore.  Perhaps it's just a phrase that's no longer popular.  Or perhaps we're no longer free.

Andrew Napolitano gave a fascinating and entertaining talk at the recent Future of Freedom conference.  In it, he details much of our history and how the government of the United States has gradually taken away our liberty.  I never realized how truly frightening the Patriot Act is.  Does giving up some liberty make us safer?  This was an excellent talk.
