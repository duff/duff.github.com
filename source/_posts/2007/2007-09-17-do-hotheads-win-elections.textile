title: "Do Hotheads Win Elections?"
---

I don't think so.  I can't remember an angry, screaming, strident candidate ever getting elected.  Has there been one?  

I watched the "Values Voters Debate":http://afa.net/debate/ and I came away thinking that many of the candidates appear to be just that - angry, screaming lunatics.   I kept thinking that Alan Keyes' head might explode.  The only candidate that seemed calm and relaxed was Huckabee.  Even Ron Paul seemed strident.  As a supporter of "Ron Paul":http://ronpaul2008.com, I'm hoping we'll get to see the Ron Paul we saw in the first debate and the "Ron Paul who was interviewed at Google":http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCM_wQy4YVg - the calm statesman whose principles and logic attracted such a huge following.  

I found the debate difficult to watch.  It seemed like it was a bunch of Christians talking about how they want to use the power of the federal government to force everyone else to act like Christians.  Don't they realize that the goverment they're advocating would then have the power to dictate how we live in the opposite direction?  Don't they see that liberty will be lost?  Do they really think that forcing people to act a certain way will change the moral character of this country?

I'm personally sick and tired of the government trying to be our mommy and trying to tell us how to live our lives.  Isn't it time to get the governemnt out of our lives?  Isn't it time for freedom in America?
