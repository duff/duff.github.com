Jim Rogers is a quite successful international investor who clearly understands economics and how to make money.  I find it quite interesting that "he refers to Ron Paul":http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_HCZeSAmqs as "the only candidate who has a clue what's going on in the world."  Ron Paul is the only candidate Jim Rogers has given money to this election cycle.  Rogers also says that Ron Paul is the only candidate he'll vote for.  He refers to the other candidates as clowns who are contributing to the problem.
