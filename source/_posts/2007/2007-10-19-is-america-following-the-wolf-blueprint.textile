title: Is America Following the Wolf Blueprint?

It seems to me that the more I learn about freedom, the more concerned I am about our future as a nation.  I found "this video":http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjALf12PAWc to be quite alarming:

It's a talk by Naomi Wolf, the author of "The End of America: A Letter of Warning to a Young Patriot":http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1933392797/realreviews-20/.  I just purchased her book.
