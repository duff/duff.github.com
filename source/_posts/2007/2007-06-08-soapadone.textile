One of the businesses I've spent a good amount of time on is Soapadoo.  A few days ago, the server that Soapadoo was hosted on had some issues in that suddenly some directories were missing.  In working with the hosting provider, we weren't able to determine the cause.  It's strange because the site had been running for about a year and nothing like this issue had ever happened before.

It would probably take me about a day to recover from the server issue and institute an improved backup system taking into account the lessons learned in the incident.  As I started on that work, I started to think about whether the work was worth it.

I've decided not to bring Soapadoo back.  Some of the reasons include:

* Soapadoo was making about $10-$30 per month in advertising revenue.  This revenue doesn't cover the hosting cost of the site.
* The site is clearly not viral or remarkable since the traffic wasn't steadily increasing.
* I don't have any ideas as to how to make Soapadoo more remarkable.
* I've learned a ton of lessons about running an advertising based business.  I think I've learned all the lessons I'm going to learn about it for now.
* I've spent very little time on Soapadoo over the past few months because I've been working on other businesses.

It's always a tough question about whether to "persevere or change gears":/blog/2007/01/06/to-quit-or-persevere to work on something different.  At this point, the other business opportunities I'm pursuing seem to have much more potential than Soapadoo.

For those Soapadoo users who would like a copy of their reviews, just send me an email about it and I can get you a copy in a number of different formats.
