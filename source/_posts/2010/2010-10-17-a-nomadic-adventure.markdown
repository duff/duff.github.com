**Here are the details of an adventure I'd like to embark on:**

* Sell most of our stuff.
* Sell our house.
* Rent a UHaul trailer and hook it up to the back of our 12 passenger van.
* Rent a furnished house in the mountains of West Virginia for 3 or 4 months.
* Work from there.  Homeschool from there.  *Live* there.
* Then rent a furnished house in another state for 3 or 4 months.
* Repeat for about 2 or 3 years.
* Proposed places: Alaska, Wyoming, Montana, [the U.P](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_Peninsula_of_Michigan), Colorado, the [Great Woods of New
Hampshire](http://www.newhampshire.com/explore-nh/north-woods.aspx), Oregon, California, Maine, and Florida.
* Come back home.

**Why do it?**

* It's a family adventure.
* Choose experiences over 'stuff'.
* We live during a time that allows us to work from most anywhere with an internet connection.  Why wait until
  we're 65 to travel?


**Open Questions:**

* How will it affect our relationships?  Don't think we'll know the answer to this one until we do the
  experiment.
* Health insurance concerns?
