I'm pleased to announce the release of a new feature of Soapbox which you bloggers out there have been asking for - Blog Syndication.

h4. Why would you want to syndicate the reviews from your blog onto Soapbox?

* More people will see your reviews.
* More people will learn about your blog.
* Each syndicated review in Soapbox contains a link to your original blog entry.
* Your reviews will matter more because they'll have more reach.
* When people are buying a product, they typically search review sites, not blogs.
* Your blog's rankings in search engines are improved as more sites refer to your blog.
* It is SO easy to mark a blog post as a Soapbox review.
