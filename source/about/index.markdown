I'm a husband, a dad, a programmer, and an entrepreneur.

My wife [Kelly](http://kellyomelia.com) and I have 7 children.  We put some [pictures on Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/omelia/) back when people used to
put pictures there.  We also used to share some of the things [happening in our family](http://omeliaramble.com).  Nowadays, it seems these
types of things end up on [App.net](https://alpha.app.net/duff) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/duffomelia).

I cofounded [Spreedly](http://spreedly.com).

I've written some code on [GitHub](http://github.com/duff).
