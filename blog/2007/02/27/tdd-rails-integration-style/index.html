<div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been writing unit tests for many years.  I can&#8217;t live without them.  Writing code from a test-driven perspective became second nature for me a long time ago.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve played with Rails integration tests on a few different projects now and each time I did, I found that there was a slight learning curve for using them.  I also found that the tests were often larger than the code I was actually testing.  The tests seemed brittle and they seemed to take <strong>such</strong> a long time to write.</p>
<p>Recently I decided that I just needed to keep writing them for awhile to see if I could get good enough at them such that they were no longer a burden to write.  A conversation with <a href="http://creativi.st/blog/">Robert</a> certainly played a part in this decision.  Since I was working on a personal project this past week, it was a perfect opportunity.</p>
<p>What I&#8217;ve found is this.  Rails integration tests are amazing.  They were taking such a long time to write because I was new at it.  They were brittle because I didn&#8217;t know what I was doing.  The tests were long because I was testing things more than once and I wasn&#8217;t refactoring to a Domain Specific Language (<span class="caps">DSL</span>) <a href="http://weblog.jamisbuck.org/2006/3/9/integration-testing-in-rails-1-1">like Jamis wrote about</a>.</p>
<p>The result is that my integration tests are now slim.  They&#8217;re cinchy to write and they&#8217;re getting easier as the <span class="caps">DSL</span> for the project improves.  I&#8217;ve gotten good enough at it that I can now write the integration test before implementing the feature.  They&#8217;re not taking very long to write at all.  It feels amazing knowing that the regression tests are accumulating and it&#8217;s becoming harder and harder to break the site I&#8217;m working on.</p>
<p>I realize now that the unit testing I did when starting out wasn&#8217;t test-driven at all.  I wrote unit tests after I wrote the code I was testing.  After developing some competence, I was able to switch over to test-driven unit tests.  A similar process has now happened with integration tests.</p>
<p>The 2 or 3 days it took to get up to speed was quite worth it.</p></div>
