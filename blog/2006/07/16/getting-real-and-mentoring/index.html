<div class="entry-content"><p>The folks at <a href="http://37signals.com">37 Signals</a> recently published a book called <a href="https://gettingreal.37signals.com">Getting Real</a> which has had a pretty significant impact on how I develop software.  37 Signals has been quite successful in creating simple, useful web applications.  I&#8217;m trying to imitate many of things they&#8217;ve done because what they&#8217;ve done works.  Why try to create my own system from scratch when I can imitate something that&#8217;s been shown to work?</p>
<p>This is the heart of mentoring.  Many of the books I&#8217;ve read about successful people talk about the advantages of mentoring.  When you find a mentor, you can typically save yourself years of time because the mentor can help you determine which parts of your study are important and which don&#8217;t matter.  I&#8217;ve seen this in my own life in learning how to trade the stock market.  I&#8217;ve been learning how to trade for 3 years.  If I didn&#8217;t have a mentor, it probably would have taken me a decade to reach the point that I&#8217;m already at.  It&#8217;s ridiculously efficient to learn from the successes and failures of a mentor.</p>
<p>Learning from published material is certainly not as great as having a personal relationship with a mentor.  Even so, you can learn a ton from folks you don&#8217;t know personally.  This is what I&#8217;m doing with the 37 Signals guys.  I don&#8217;t know them personally but they have affected most of the decisions I make when developing a web site.  I&#8217;ve already started to see some benefits of their approach as I&#8217;ve developed <a href="http://soapboxit.com">Soapbox</a>.  Rather than trying to guess what my customers want, I&#8217;ve been focused on releasing something that provides people some value and letting them drive the features they find necessary.  It&#8217;s been interesting to see that a feature I didn&#8217;t think would be useful has been suggested by an enormous percentage of the people who have used the site.  Person after person made the same suggestion.  I can now see the advantages of having that feature.</p>
<p>If I wasn&#8217;t imitating 37 Signals, it would have taken me many more months to release Soapbox and the site would have been much more complicated and harder to use. <a href="https://gettingreal.37signals.com">Getting Real</a> is an excellent book that could help your business even if you&#8217;re doing something other than software development.</p></div>
