<div class="entry-content"><p>It&#8217;s been about 2 days since I started actively marketing Soapbox.  I thought I&#8217;d share some of the things that have been happening in the hope that you can benefit from these experiences in your own business.  It&#8217;s been pretty interesting so far.</p>
<p>I sent out announcement emails to approximately 500 people who were in my address book.  I know about 200 of these people pretty well, at least well enough to send a semi-personal email.  As for the other 300 people, they&#8217;re either acquaintances who I don&#8217;t know very well or they&#8217;re people I don&#8217;t remember.  I figured I&#8217;d send the announcement to all of them.  I haven&#8217;t spoken to many of the people I emailed in a long time so the announcement has triggered a large number of catch up emails.</p>
<p>So far, 88 people have signed up on Soapbox and they&#8217;ve written 154 reviews.  I&#8217;m pretty excited about the progress and I&#8217;m in no real hurry.  I&#8217;m perfectly fine with gradually spreading the word about the site and gradually improving it over time.  Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I&#8217;d be excited if it went viral but I&#8217;m OK with gradual.  I&#8217;ve never done any marketing so I&#8217;m excited to learn more about it by actually <em>doing</em> it.</p>
<p>The internet is pretty wild.  One friend submitted Soapbox to a blog site with thousands of subscribers and it was accepted.  Thanks Craig!  Soapbox also showed up on another blog I&#8217;ve never heard of.  It was submitted there by someone I don&#8217;t know.  Here are the references on the two sites:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.buzzshout.com/listing.php?name=Soapbox">http://www.buzzshout.com/</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.emilychang.com/go/ehub/app/soapbox/">http://www.emilychang.com/go/ehub/</a></p>
<p>It was surprising to see references to Soapbox out on the internet so soon after starting to yap about it.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve also got a few interesting statistics.  Before the marketing blitz, Soapbox was getting about 700 hits per day.  Since the marketing campaign started, it&#8217;s getting about 22,000 hits per day.  So, there are certainly folks taking a peek at it at this point.</p>
<p>It remains to be seen whether the site goes from &#8220;something a little interesting that Duff&#8217;s been working on&#8221; to &#8220;this is a useful site that provides me value.&#8221;  It remains to be seen whether it goes from a site that a few people use to a site that&#8217;s remarkable enough that people feel compelled to tell their friends about it.  <a href="http://sethgodin.com">Seth Godin</a> has taught me that customers can do a way better job of marketing a product than I can.</p>
<p>The questions remain, what can I do to make the site that remarkable?  What can I do to make it very easy to spread this idea virus?  I&#8217;m going to be working on answering those questions in the coming weeks.</p></div>
