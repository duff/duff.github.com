<div class="entry-content"><p>Now that some friends have been writing reviews on <a href="http://soapboxit.com">Soapbox</a>, I&#8217;ve recognized a few unexpected things.</p>
<p>The site doesn&#8217;t have to be an enormous hit in order to provide a ton of value to the people in &#8220;my&#8221; network.  So even if it doesn&#8217;t have 4,000,000 reviews out there, I can still benefit if &#8220;my network&#8221; is relatively filled out and a number of friends start writing reviews.  I have learned a ton of things from the reviews that have been posted so far and it&#8217;s only been 2 days.  I thought I knew my brother Russ pretty well.  He&#8217;s posted a ton of reviews of things I never realized he&#8217;s used.  They&#8217;ve prompted many conversations between us and I think we&#8217;ve learned more about each other through Soapbox.  I&#8217;m not sure whether other networks of people will use Soapbox enough to experience this benefit.</p>
<p>I have found that there&#8217;s value in having my opinions of things in digital form.  I&#8217;ve found myself emailing the links of reviews to people.  For example, many have been asking about the designer of Soapbox.  Rather than me crafting an email about Richard Powell, I can just point them to my <a href="http://soapboxit.com/review/42">review</a> of his work.  Someone asked about how I&#8217;m liking the switch to using a Mac.  I just point them to the <a href="http://soapboxit.com/review/0">review</a>.  It seems quite efficient.</p>
<p>Russ has made me realize that we have used thousands of products and services.  There are countless things to review.</p>
<p>My mom has recently made me realize that we naturally exchange reviews all the time with friends and loved ones.  We&#8217;re constantly comparing notes, sharing experiences, and learning from each other.  Soapbox enables this communication to happen very efficiently with a ton of people.</p>
<p>Soapbox could start to connect friends of friends in real life because of the reviews that were written online.  That would be pretty excellent.  We&#8217;ve already had a case hinting at this when my wife Kelly went to a playgroup with a few other moms with their kids.  One of the moms there was talking about Jen&#8217;s <a href="http://soapboxit.com/review/63">Tilapia Review</a>!  This mom has never met Jen and has never tried Tilapia.  But if and when they do meet, they&#8217;ll have some context for conversation.  It&#8217;s just exciting to me that a digital process on the web hasn&#8217;t replaced human interaction.  It seems to have encouraged it and fostered it.</p></div>
