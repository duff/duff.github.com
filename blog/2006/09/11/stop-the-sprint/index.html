<div class="entry-content"><p><img class="right" src="/images/posts/2006/skater.jpg"></p>
<p>I recently learned a few lessons about planning and achieving long term objectives.</p>
<p>I used to do very little planning.  I&#8217;d spend all of the available time I had on a daily basis working away at both short term and long term objectives.  I&#8217;d just work and work and keep on working and have no end in sight each day.  As you might imagine, this lack of planning approach didn&#8217;t work.  I worked my tail off and never felt like I had achieved much.</p>
<p>Then my wife Kelly helped me to understand that it would be much better if I broke my day down into time slots.  Each time slot was an amount of time I desired to spend on each goal every day.  A basic time boxing approach.  So there were time slots for Bible study, for consulting, for trading and learning about the stock market, for creating businesses, etc.  If I didn&#8217;t get too much done during a time slot, that was ok.  I did my best that day using the time I had available.  I didn&#8217;t need to keep beating myself up about not accomplishing enough.  I was spending the time I had intended to spend, I was <a href="http://www.stevepavlina.com/articles/courage-to-live-consciously.htm">living consciously</a>, and I was living my life with a long and steady marathon pace that worked.</p>
<p>There have been weeks though when things didn&#8217;t seem to work out very well.  Last week was one of them.  I think I&#8217;ve just now realized why.  You see, last week was a busy <a href="http://soapboxit.com">Soapbox</a> week.  I released a new feature that bloggers started talking about.  (<a href="http://www.centernetworks.com/soapbox-review">CenterNetworks</a>, <a href="http://www.makeyougohmm.com/20060907/3751/">TDavid</a>, <a href="http://schulzone.org/2006/09/06/more-and-better/">Schulzone</a>, <a href="http://stuffeddog.com/archives/57.html">TheStuffedDog</a>, and my friend <a href="http://rc3.org/2006/09/soapbox.php">Rafe</a>) There seemed to be so much that <strong>had</strong> to get done.  So I bulled through and did those things.  I was really enjoying it and it was stuff that was fun to do.  I had started sprinting to accelerate the &#8220;creating businesses&#8221; goal because that&#8217;s what needed to be done that week.  This sprint was at the expense of the other goals.  That extra time I spent sprinting had to come from somewhere.  I knew at the time what I was doing but I justified it by saying things like &#8220;it&#8217;s ok&#8230; I&#8217;ll catch up later&#8230;&#8221; Or, &#8220;sometimes these things take precedence&#8230;&#8221;  Whatever.  It boils down to not sticking to the plan.</p>
<p>I was able to make a ton of progress in one area of my life.  But the other areas were neglected.  So I got to the end of the week and felt like I couldn&#8217;t keep up with things.  I felt like life was so hectic and overwhelming.  I felt like I wasn&#8217;t accomplishing the things I had set out to accomplish.  Some of the balls being juggled were hitting the floor.  All of these feelings were completely justified because I <strong>HADN&#8217;T</strong> accomplished the things I had wanted to.  I <strong>HADN&#8217;T</strong> made some progress toward each of the objectives.  Some of the objectives were completely abandoned on a given day.  Zero progress on that objective.</p>
<p>This &#8220;sprint on one goal at the expense of others&#8221; is not a good idea for me.  It worked much better when I took a disciplined, long term approach and completely time boxed each of my activities for the day.  Then I always got to the end of the week feeling like I was juggling all of the balls successfully.  I was taking a step each day toward each of the goals.  No balls were ever hitting the floor.  No feeling of being overwhelmed.  No feeling of a hectic life.  I had taken the finite amount of time I had, broken it up into sections, and worked for each of the sections.  I did the best I could with the time I had been given.</p>
<p>My friend Joe said it well &#8211; <a href="http://joebal.blogspot.com/2006/09/day-31-one-ninety-two.html">&#8216;Long lasting self-discipline is better than doing things in spurts that ultimately don&#8217;t stick.&#8217;</a>  Joe was talking in the context of losing some weight.  I think it&#8217;s a generally applicable principle of goal achievement.</p>
<p>Another realization I had was that there are things on my daily list that <span class="caps">MUST</span> get done and there are things that are nice to haves that I really enjoy working on.  I realize now that I need to completely finish the must-haves before even thinking about the nice-to-haves.  If I do them in the other order, the time slots for the nice-to-haves often get extended leaving less time for the must-haves.  I think it&#8217;s a much better approach to finish the must-haves first and then know that anything else I accomplish that day is gravy.  It&#8217;s almost like I need to work on the must-haves to deserve the opportunity to work on the things I&#8217;m really looking forward to doing.  I&#8217;m working toward that reward which makes the must-haves more enjoyable.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m no longer going to justify the sprint.  The marathon approach seems to work better.</p></div>
